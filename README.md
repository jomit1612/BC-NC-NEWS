Welcome to the Back End of my News app.

This is the news API server built using PSQL, express and node.js. The API was created using the following:
•	A model-view controller pattern to handle server requests.
•	Test driven development using Jest and Supertest to test API functions.
•	Error Handling: endpoints have custom error codes and messaging.
•	Heroku for hosting the API.

The hosted API can be found at https://nc-news-jt-app.herokuapp.com/api/articles.
